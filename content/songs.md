## Horses 4k - "Barely a Horse, Mostly a Pony"
**Date:** August 15, 2025
**Rating:** 3.5/4
**Featured:** ⭐
**Description:** The sound of a horse looking out at the sea and thinking about frisbees and the sadness of Tolstoy. Seagulls flutter. The wind; it smells like Elvis's hairspray. I want to drop a rock into the ocean and pray for its safety. It's adorable zoomers think they discovered y'alternative and have the right to ban the term. Spider-Man weeps, but not alone.
