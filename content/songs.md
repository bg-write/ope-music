## Wednesday - "Bitter Everyday"
**Date:** August 19, 2025
**Rating:** 0.5/4
**Featured:** ⭐
**Description:** I'd rather lick Kid Rock's dinghy than listen to any more 2020s shoegaze. Even mildew and regret got bored by this song.

## Joyce Manor - "All My Friends Are So Depressed"
**Date:** August 18, 2025
**Rating:** 1/4
**Featured:** ⭐
**Description:** Why is everyone trying to do alt-country poorly now. The Civil War reenactment of Old 97's no one asked for.

## Horses 4k - "Barely a Horse, Mostly a Pony"
**Date:** August 15, 2025
**Rating:** 3.5/4
**Featured:** ⭐
**Description:** The sound of a horse staring at the sea, pondering frisbees and Tolstoy. Seagulls heckle. The wind; it smells like Elvis's hairspray. And zoomers — bless them — think they invented y'alternative just to ban it, like they're trying to outlaw sadness itself.
