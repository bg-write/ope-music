# TODO List
## ðŸŽ¯ Billboard Scraper MVP - 4-Day Plan

### **Day 1: Data Extraction Fix (1 hour)**
**Goal**: Fix the scraper to extract ALL 100 chart entries (ranks 1-100)
**Theme**: Complete Data Coverage
**Benchmark**: Successfully scrape 100/100 chart entries with no missing ranks

**15-Minute Tasks:**
1. **Task 1 (0-15 min)**: Debug why 20 chart entries are being filtered out
   - Add logging to show exactly which entries fail validation
   - Check the filtering logic in `_parse_chart_html` method

2. âœ… **Task 2 (15-30 min)**: Test with sample HTML to identify the filtering issue
   - âœ… Run scraper with verbose logging enabled
   - âœ… Identify which specific entries are being dropped
   - **Result**: Artist names are hidden in social media share URLs (Facebook/Twitter quote parameters)

3. âœ… **Task 3 (30-45 min)**: Fix the data extraction logic
   - âœ… Update selectors or parsing methods as needed
   - âœ… Test with a small sample to verify fixes
   - **Result**: Successfully extracted all 100 entries by parsing artist names from social media share URLs

4. âœ… **Task 4 (45-60 min)**: Implement featuring field enhancement âœ…
- âœ… Create new `featuring` field to capture features, duets, collaborations
- âœ… Update `_extract_artist_from_share_urls` to extract full artist info from social media URLs
- âœ… Update `_parse_artist_collaboration` to handle different artist string formats
- âœ… **SIMPLIFIED APPROACH**: Keep full artist string in `artist` field as written by Billboard
- âœ… **Result**: Artist field now contains complete information like "Morgan Wallen Featuring Tate McRae", "Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars", etc.

**ðŸŽ‰ DAY 1 COMPLETE! GOAL ACHIEVED: Successfully scrape 100/100 chart entries with no missing ranks!**

### **Day 2: Data Quality & Validation (1 hour)**
**Goal**: Ensure all extracted data is clean and accurate
**Theme**: Data Integrity
**Benchmark**: 100 clean entries with proper titles, artists, and no artifacts

**15-Minute Tasks:**
1. âœ… **Task 1 (0-15 min)**: Review extracted data for accuracy âœ…
   - âœ… Compare with actual Billboard site
   - âœ… Identify any remaining data quality issues
   - **Result**: Data quality is excellent! All 100 entries have clean, accurate song titles and artist names. No HTML artifacts, navigation elements, or missing fields found. Artist names are properly formatted (e.g., "Morgan Wallen Featuring Tate McRae", "Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars", "HUNTR/X: EJAE, Audrey Nuna & REI AMI").

2. âœ… **Task 2 (15-30 min)**: Fix any remaining social media text or navigation artifacts âœ…
     - âœ… Clean up artist names and song titles
     - âœ… Remove any Billboard site navigation elements
     - **Result**: Data is completely clean! No HTML artifacts, navigation text, or social media elements found. All 100 entries have proper formatting. Only minor note: Rank 87 has title "TN" which appears to be a legitimate short song title.

3. âœ… **Task 3 (30-45 min)**: Validate that artist names match actual Billboard data âœ…
   - âœ… Cross-reference with official chart data
   - âœ… Ensure consistency in naming conventions
   - **Result**: VALIDATION PASSED! All 100 entries are accurate and complete. Found 9 "Featuring" entries, 21 "&" collaborations, 2 "With" entries. All ranks present (1-100), no missing fields, no HTML artifacts. Data quality is excellent.

4. âœ… **Task 4 (45-60 min)**: Test data quality with sample validation âœ…
   - âœ… Run validation tests on cleaned data
   - âœ… Confirm all 100 entries pass quality checks
   - **Result**: ALL TESTS PASSED! 16/16 tests with 100% success rate. Data completeness, rank validation, quality checks, formatting, artist patterns, date consistency, distribution, and sample validation all passed. Data quality is excellent!

**Success Criteria**: All 100 entries have clean, accurate song titles and artist names
