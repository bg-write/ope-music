# OPE! Deployment Guide

## 🚀 **Status: Ready to Deploy!**

Your OPE! website is **production-ready** and can be deployed immediately. This guide covers the simple deployment process.

## 📋 **Pre-Deployment Checklist**

Before deploying, ensure you have:

- ✅ **Working local site** - `npm run build` completes successfully
- ✅ **Content added** - At least one song and one album review
- ✅ **Images included** - `logo.png` and `author.png` in `images/` folder
- ✅ **Favicon files** - `favicon.ico`, `favicon-16x16.png`, `favicon-32x32.png`

## 🌐 **Deployment Options**

### **Option 1: Netlify (Recommended - Free & Easy)**

1. **Build your site:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)**
   - Sign up/login with GitHub (recommended)

3. **Deploy:**
   - Drag and drop your entire `ope/` folder to Netlify
   - Or connect your GitHub repository for automatic deployments

4. **Customize domain:**
   - Netlify gives you a random URL (e.g., `amazing-music-123.netlify.app`)
   - You can customize this in the site settings

**Pros:** Free, automatic HTTPS, very easy, great performance

### **Option 2: GitHub Pages (Free)**

1. **Create a GitHub repository:**
   - Name it something like `ope-music-website`
   - Make it public

2. **Push your files:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial OPE! website"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/ope-music-website.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to repository Settings → Pages
   - Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder
   - Click Save

4. **Your site will be available at:**
   `https://yourusername.github.io/ope-music-website`

**Pros:** Free, version control, easy updates
**Cons:** Slightly more complex setup

### **Option 3: Any Static Hosting**

Your site is just static files, so it works anywhere:
- **Vercel** - Similar to Netlify
- **Firebase Hosting** - Google's hosting
- **AWS S3 + CloudFront** - Enterprise option
- **Traditional web hosting** - Upload via FTP

## 📁 **Files to Upload**

After running `npm run build`, upload these files and folders:

```
📁 ope/
├── 📄 index.html          # Main website
├── 📄 styles.css          # Styling
├── 📁 images/             # Logo and author images
│   ├── logo.png
│   └── author.png
├── 📄 favicon.ico         # Browser tab icon
├── 📄 favicon-16x16.png
└── 📄 favicon-32x32.png
```

**Note:** You don't need to upload:
- `build.js` (build script)
- `content/` folder (Markdown files)
- `package.json` (Node.js config)
- Other development files

## 🔄 **Updating Your Live Site**

### **After making content changes:**

1. **Edit your Markdown files** (`content/songs.md`, `content/albums.md`, etc.)

2. **Rebuild locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Upload the updated files** to your hosting platform

### **For automatic updates (Netlify/GitHub):**
- Just push changes to your repository
- The site automatically rebuilds and deploys

## 🌍 **Custom Domain (Optional)**

### **Netlify:**
1. Go to Site Settings → Domain Management
2. Add your custom domain (e.g., `ope-music.com`)
3. Follow the DNS instructions

### **GitHub Pages:**
1. Create a `CNAME` file in your repository with your domain
2. Update your DNS settings as instructed

## 📱 **Post-Deployment Testing**

After deploying, test:

- ✅ **Homepage loads** correctly

- ✅ **Search works** on both tabs
- ✅ **Share links** work properly
- ✅ **Mobile responsive** on different devices
- ✅ **Images display** correctly
- ✅ **Favicon shows** in browser tab

## 🚨 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Images not showing:**

- Check that `index.html` was updated

### **Search not working:**
