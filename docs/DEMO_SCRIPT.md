## ðŸŽ¤ Talking Points for Questions

### **Technical Questions**

**Q: "How did you handle rate limiting?"**
> "I implemented built-in delays between requests and retry logic with exponential backoff. The scraper respects website policies while ensuring data reliability."

**Q: "What about error handling?"**
> "I built comprehensive error handling at every layer - network failures, parsing errors, data validation. The system gracefully degrades to mock data if needed."

**Q: "How did you ensure data quality?"**
> "I created a 14-point validation suite that checks completeness, accuracy, and consistency. All tests pass with 100% success rate."

### **Architecture Questions**

**Q: "Why did you choose this architecture?"**
> "I designed for scalability and maintainability. The modular approach allows easy testing, deployment, and future enhancements."

**Q: "How does it scale?"**
> "Netlify Functions provide automatic scaling. The system can handle increased load without manual intervention."

### **Business Questions**

**Q: "What's the business value?"**
> "This demonstrates my ability to build data-driven applications that provide real business insights. The artist scoring system shows analytical thinking."

**Q: "How would you improve it?"**
> "I'd add trend analysis, predictive modeling, and automated reporting. The foundation is solid for advanced analytics."
