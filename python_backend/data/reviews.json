      "review_text": "The Spoon of theater kids but doomed to jazz hands. The pre-chorus drum fumble (\"breakdown\" is felony-level generous) is bad yet Florence can still out-sing the man yelling at pigeons behind the 7-Eleven.",

      "review_text": "The sound of a horse staring at the sea, pondering frisbees and Tolstoy. Seagulls heckle. The wind; it smells like Elvis's hairspray. And zoomers — bless them — think they invented y'alternative just to ban it, like they're trying to outlaw sadness itself.",
